# Eintagsmessage

Eintagsmessage is a simple application for one time messages. You can create simple text messages you don't want to show up in your chat logs or email conversations (e.g. passwords or other secrets). Share them with friends or yourself on other devices. Before you can view the message it's deleted, so you can't view it again. All messages will be deleted one day ('Ein Tag' in german) after they're created.
